9,Ken Jee,"Data Science and Sports Analytics are my passions. My name is Ken Jee and I have been working in the data science field doing sports analytics for the last 5 years. I have held data science positions in companies ranging from startups to fortune 100 organizations.  I transitioned into data science from a business and consulting background. When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost; there were very few resources for me to learn about this field from. I decided to start making YouTube videos to share my experiences and to hopefully help others get break into the data science and sports analytics fields. 

On this channel I produce fun and informative Data Science and Sports Analytics Content. My goal is to provide insight into the data science community, career advice, and sports related analysis.

A little about myself:

I did my undergraduate at the University of Toronto where I studied pharmacology. I was pre-med but decided I would be a terrible doctor üò±. I worked in bioinformatics for a year and then did my masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania.
