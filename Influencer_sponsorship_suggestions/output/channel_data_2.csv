1,John Coogan,"Co-founder of http://soylent.com and http://lucy.co

I've been an entrepreneur for nearly a decade across multiple companies. I've done a lot of work in silicon valley, so that's mostly what I talk about. I've raised over 10 rounds of venture capital totaling over $100m in total funding. 

I work mostly in tech-enabled consumer packaged goods, meaning I use software to make the best products possible and then deliver them to the widest possible audience. I'm a big fan of machine learning, python programming, and motion graphics.

19,Cl√©ment Mihailescu,"I'm an Ex-Google Software Engineer, an Ex-Facebook Software Engineer, and the CEO and co-founder of AlgoExpert (algoexpert.io), a website that helps Software Engineers prepare for coding interviews.

After graduating with a degree in Mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania in May 2016, I decided to learn programming and to enroll in Fullstack Academy, an immersive coding bootcamp in New York City. While there, I fell in love with full-stack development and algorithm analysis. Upon completion of the program, I dove deeper into the field of algorithms and aced the Google interviews. The frustration that I felt during my interview prep led me to creating AlgoExpert.
