9208,OpenDaylight (ODL) and Mininet demo - SDN & OpenFlow on GNS3,David Bombal,"This is a demo from my GNS3 SDN course: 
Link: http://academy.gns3.com/courses/a-practical-sdn-and-openflow-introduction

A practical, hands-on, real world approach to learning and implementing SDN and OpenFlow.


See SDN and OpenFlow in action. Learn SDN and OpenFlow practically. You can set up everything shown here on your laptop using free or demo software.

Learn all tiers of the SDN Architecture:

* Applications - Wireshark, Bash scripts, FlowMaker, HP Network Protector, HP Network Visualizer

* Controllers - Learn OpenDaylight (ODL), ONOS, RYU and the HP VAN SDN Controllers.

* OpenFlow Infrastructure - Mininet switches (Open vSwitch)

Wireshark:
Capture OpenFlow messages using both Linux and Windows based Wireshark.

Technical content:
No sales hype, no fluff. Just technical content.

OVAs:

As part of the course, I have made OVAs available of ODL, RYU and the HP VAN SDN Controller. I have also provided links to download OVAs directly for ONOS and Mininet.

Real world SDN examples:

* The NSA

* Google

* Microsoft Azure

* Facebook

* Microsoft Linux

Update 10 November 2015:

Based on feedback, additional videos discussing the installation of apps on the HP controller have been added:

* Install HP Controller

* Troubleshoot browser issues

* Install FlowMaker on HP Controller

* Troubleshoot app install issues

Update 25 October 2015:

Additional videos added to the course discussing:

* Do you need to replace switches to use SDN?

* Do you need to run OpenFlow everywhere in your network?

* How does OpenFlow and Spanning Tree interact?

* Does a single controller manage the entire network?",demo gns sdn course link http academy gns courses practical sdn openflow introduction practical hands real world approach learning implementing sdn openflow see sdn openflow action learn sdn openflow practically set everything shown laptop using free demo software learn tiers sdn architecture applications wireshark bash scripts flowmaker hp network protector hp network visualizer controllers learn opendaylight odl onos ryu hp van sdn controllers openflow infrastructure mininet switches open vswitch wireshark capture openflow messages using linux windows based wireshark technical content sales hype fluff technical content ovas course made ovas available odl ryu hp van sdn controller also provided links download ovas directly onos mininet real world sdn examples nsa google microsoft azure facebook microsoft linux update november based feedback additional videos discussing installation apps hp controller added install hp controller troubleshoot browser issues install flowmaker hp controller troubleshoot app install issues update october additional videos added course discussing need replace switches use sdn need run openflow everywhere network openflow spanning tree interact single controller manage entire network,opendaylight odl mininet demo sdn openflow gns,demo gns sdn course link http academy gns course practical sdn openflow introduction practical hand real world approach learning implementing sdn openflow see sdn openflow action learn sdn openflow practically set everything shown laptop using free demo software learn tier sdn architecture application wireshark bash script flowmaker hp network protector hp network visualizer controller learn opendaylight odl ono ryu hp van sdn controller openflow infrastructure mininet switch open vswitch wireshark capture openflow message using linux window based wireshark technical content sale hype fluff technical content ovas course made ovas available odl ryu hp van sdn controller also provided link download ovas directly ono mininet real world sdn example nsa google microsoft azure facebook microsoft linux update november based feedback additional video discussing installation apps hp controller added install hp controller troubleshoot browser issue install flowmaker hp controller troubleshoot app install issue update october additional video added course discussing need replace switch use sdn need run openflow everywhere network openflow spanning tree interact single controller manage entire network,demo gn sdn cours link http academi gn cours practic sdn openflow introduct practic hand real world approach learn implement sdn openflow see sdn openflow action learn sdn openflow practic set everyth shown laptop use free demo softwar learn tier sdn architectur applic wireshark bash script flowmak hp network protector hp network visual control learn opendaylight odl ono ryu hp van sdn control openflow infrastructur mininet switch open vswitch wireshark captur openflow messag use linux window base wireshark technic content sale hype fluff technic content ova cours made ova avail odl ryu hp van sdn control also provid link download ova directli ono mininet real world sdn exampl nsa googl microsoft azur facebook microsoft linux updat novemb base feedback addit video discuss instal app hp control ad instal hp control troubleshoot browser issu instal flowmak hp control troubleshoot app instal issu updat octob addit video ad cours discuss need replac switch use sdn need run openflow everywher network openflow span tree interact singl control manag entir network,"['opendaylight', 'odl', 'mininet', 'demo', 'sdn', 'openflow']",0

564,📚 How to use SharePoint Document Library - Beginners Tutorial,Kevin Stratvert,"In this step-by-step tutorial, learn how you can use document libraries in Microsoft SharePoint. A document library provides a secure place to store files where you and your co-workers can find them easily, work on them together, and access them from any device at any time. For example, you can use a document library on a site in SharePoint to store all files related to a specific project or a specific client. Adding files or moving files between folders is as easy as dragging and dropping them from one location to another.

3098,Coding A Social Network Platform part 2 || The Startup Vlog,Kalle Hallden,"Coding A Social Network Platform part 2 || The Startup Vlog

""Clean Code Friday""
If you want to receive one short email from me every week, where I go through a few of the most useful things I have explored and discovered this week. Things like; favourite apps, articles, podcasts, books, coding tips and tricks. Then feel free to join https://kalletech.com/clean-code-friday/

So I figured that it might be interesting to make a vlog about my ""startup"" and kind of show you the journey from start to finish.
I will reveal what the project is going to be as soon as I can but for now all I can say is that it will have social network components.
In this video I continue building out the api and the postgresql database. I build out the system for a note taking app in order to test how more intricate api and database structures would work. And I also create a Flutter app to call the api and get notes and add notes via the app to the database.
I hope you enjoy it! :)

Hey Refuers! Clark with another DAILY upload. Woo-hoo - we're flying by. 

The goal of these videos is to serve you and inspire you to take on this method of success journal — photos from all around the world. All ages. All incomes. All goals. All journal! Over 550,000 people have SEEN journaling series videos. Emails and photos flooding inbox. Community online of Journal Nerds— walk through five great tips for you in this video on how to keep a journal.

Get the NEW MyBestJournal2.0 Program Here ► http://www.mybestjournal.com

SUMMARY: 
1. This is NOT a diary. Think of it as a success log to coach yourself. Don’t treat it as an area to make problems smaller - your journal is a tool to take your success and make it bigger!

2. Get a sketchbook. blank - no rules. good gear - also helpful (G2/sharpie highlighter)

3. Use Your Front Cover for Self Summary
i.e. What are YOUR rules? What do you live by? Constitution for USA, Mission Statement for Business. Use your front cover to list all that sort of stuff. i.e. inspiration, BEST quotes, Power of I AM, Signature Strengths

4. Set Goals in Your Back Cover
If you’re not GROWING you’re dying. So many people talk, few people DO. — NY resolutions!? The secret to achieving your goals is to revisit DAILY. Set goals in three areas: WORK/REST/PLAY. Also awesome: look at previous years BIG goals and see what you were working on/BIG goals for that year

5. Frequency
ONLY ONE RULE: when you feel like it. don’t force it - a place of inspiration NOT an obligation. Get emails from people who are ashamed they stopped or beat themselves up for missing a week. ALL GOOD! Look at the journal and get AMPED. Only positive feelings with it - don’t ever look and think “I really should…..”
once per year - swap out completely even if not full

6. Get GOOD Questions
good questions are MAKE or BREAK. upgrade life = upgrade questions you’re asking. I got 30 days of questions in NEW MBJ2.0
30-Day Coaching ends with 2-3 questions. 60-90 of them total!!

4023,How to Stop Procrastinating and Study for Your CCNA CCNP,NetworkChuck,"How to Stop Procrastinating and Study for Your CCNA CCNP.

I can’t say this enough, it is the BEST method I have found to effectively obliterate procrastination and revolutionize your CCNA CCNP studies.

How to Study for the CCNA CCNP with the Pomodoro Technique

1. Pick one study task to work on. 
2. Only work on this task for 25 minutes. 
3. During this 25 minute session, write down any distractions.
4. Take a 5 minute break. Then rinse and repeat.

#CCNA #PacketTracer #CCENT

This is a Packet Tracer VTP Troubleshooting lab. Can you fix the network?

VLAN Trunk Protocol (VTP) reduces administration in a switched network. When you configure a new VLAN on one VTP server, the VLAN is distributed through all switches in the domain. This reduces the need to configure the same VLAN everywhere. VTP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol that is available on most of the Cisco Catalyst series products.
 

VTP packets are sent in either Inter-Switch Link (ISL) frames or in IEEE 802.1Q (dot1q) frames. These packets are sent to the destination MAC address 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC with a logical link control (LLC) code of Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) (AAAA) and a type of 2003 (in the SNAP header).

Transcription:

This is a VTP or VLAN Trunking Protocol troubleshooting lab. 
In this lab, you need to troubleshoot the following issues.  
When VLANs are added to switch 1, the switch on the left the VLANs are not replicated to other switches in the topology, so in other words, when a VLAN is added to the VLAN database, VTP is not synchronizing those VLANs to the other switches in the topology. 

Now in this lab, you need to troubleshoot that and make sure that you fix the network so that when VLANs are added to switch 1, the other switches in the topology learn about the new VLANs. 

In other words, you need to make sure that other VLAN database are synchronized.  
Now in this lab, don’t make any changes to switch 1 except for adding additional VLANs. You need to troubleshoot the issues on the other switches. so don’t make any changes to the configuration of switch 1 apart from adding additional VLANs to prove that VTP is working properly. 

Try to complete this lab without using the show run or show start commands. 
Use other commands on the switches such as show VTP status or other commands to see what the problem is.  

So as an example, show vtp status 
shows me the status of VTP on the switch. Use show commands such as this to see what’s going on. See where the problems are and then fix the network. Try not to use show run or show start unless you really have to.  

So can you fix this network?  
Download the packet tracer file and see if you can fix the network yourself, otherwise watch the next video where I fix the network.",snmp packet tracer file pt version bit ly zymhgf get packet tracer

#CCNA #PacketTracer #CCENT

Two prominent security protocols used to control access into networks are Cisco TACACS+ and RADIUS. The RADIUS specification is described in RFC 2865 leavingcisco.com, which obsoletes RFC 2138 leavingcisco.com. Cisco is committed to supporting both protocols with the best of class offerings. It is not the intention of Cisco to compete with RADIUS or influence users to use TACACS+. You should choose the solution that best meets your needs. This document discusses the differences between TACACS+ and RADIUS, so that you can make an informed choice.

Cisco has supported the RADIUS protocol since Cisco IOS® Software Release 11.1 in February 1996. Cisco continues to enhance the RADIUS Client with new features and capabilities, supporting RADIUS as a standard.

Cisco seriously evaluated RADIUS as a security protocol before it developed TACACS+. Many features were included in the TACACS+ protocol to meet the needs of the growing security market. The protocol was designed to scale as networks grow, and to adapt to new security technology as the market matures. The underlying architecture of the TACACS+ protocol complements the independent authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) architecture.


RADIUS uses UDP while TACACS+ uses TCP. TCP offers several advantages over UDP. TCP offers a connection-oriented transport, while UDP offers best-effort delivery. RADIUS requires additional programmable variables such as re-transmit attempts and time-outs to compensate for best-effort transport, but it lacks the level of built-in support that a TCP transport offers:

TCP usage provides a separate acknowledgment that a request has been received, within (approximately) a network round-trip time (RTT), regardless of how loaded and slow the backend authentication mechanism (a TCP acknowledgment) might be.

TCP provides immediate indication of a crashed, or not running, server by a reset (RST). You can determine when a server crashes and returns to service if you use long-lived TCP connections. UDP cannot tell the difference between a server that is down, a slow server, and a non-existent server.

Using TCP keepalives, server crashes can be detected out-of-band with actual requests. Connections to multiple servers can be maintained simultaneously, and you only need to send messages to the ones that are known to be up and running.

TCP is more scalable and adapts to growing, as well as congested, networks.",packet tracer file pt version goo gl etvxlq get packet tracer course clicking goo gl vikgkn get icnd icnd courses goo gl xr

I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

10797,FINALLY! Properly Present Your Power BI Dashboard in PowerPoint (keep the interactivity),Leila Gharani,"Join 300,000+ professionals in our courses: https://www.xelplus.com/courses/

How do you embed your interactive dashboard in a PowerPoint presentation without losing the interactivity side of the dashboard? Forget adding a link to your original dashboard that takes you to a separate application. You also do NOT want to add static images to your slides you have to manually update! Instead, use the NEW Power BI add-in integration for PowerPoint.  This keeps the interactive experience of Microsoft Power BI inside your PowerPoint presentations. You keep your data filters, tooltips, bookmarks, and drill-through functionality. I'll cover what happens when you save the presentation. How changes flow and the different embedding options you have.

Transcription:

This is an ACL or Access Control List lab.  

We’ve been told that we need to restrict traffic internally using Router 1 as follows. 
One of the big decisions to make is where are you going to bind the access list. We’ve been told to bind it in the most efficient place on Router 1.  

In these examples, we are restricting traffic from the user PCs. The most efficient place to bind the access list would be here gigabit 0/0/0

 That’s because we don’t want other router to have to process the traffic and then simply drop it on the outbound interface.  Extended access lists allow us to be very granular and we are able to specify individual traffic types and port numbers when permitting or denying traffic. 

So this is where we’re going to bind the access list. We generally want to bind extended access lists as close to the source as possible to stop a devices having to process the traffic and then simply drop it.  

Now firstly we need to permit traffic from PC1 to HTTP server 1 using HTTP. 
So here’s our router. 

show ip interface brief

We can see the IP addresses on the router. The router has been configured with IP addresses already.  This PC has an IP address of 10.1.2.101
Now for the real world and for the exam, don’t forget the command ipconfig that also shows you the IP address of the PC. 

So it has an IP address of 10.1.2.101
This server has an IP address of 10.1.1.100
So we want to permit traffic from this IP address to this IP address but only permit HTTP. We’ve been told which access list number to use so that makes it simple. 

Remember, extended access lists have this range. 
Standard IP access lists have this range. 
Now if you check with us on the real device, you’ll notice that there are actually additional numbers.  

So in this example, I’ll telnet to a real physical router that I have and if I type access-list?
Notice standard access list in the range 1 to 99 but there’s also this range which is called the expanded range. 

IP extended access list are in this range. But there’s also this expanded range of  extended IP access list for the exam. Those are the two most important ranges to know and that’s what we have in packet tracer.  

So on the router access list 100 and we are going to permit specific traffic. First we’re using TCP here because HTTP resides on top of TCP. Now the source address is going to be a host 10.1.2.101 
so, 10.1.2.101

Now we could use greater than but we’re not going to do that here.  The destination is our server 10.1.1.100 so 10.1.1.100

We need to specify the port number which in our example is going to be 80 HTTP. 

So now, do show run pipe include access. 
Notice this line access list 100 permit TCP host 10.1. 2.101 host 10.1.1.100 equal www.  

So the router has automatically converted to port number to a word which is fine, so that’s the first access list entry.",packet tracer file goo gl z umkk get packet tracer course clicking goo gl

916,iWOWNfit i6HRC Fitness Tracker - Comprehensive Review,Kevin Stratvert,"The i6HRC (i6 HR C) is an inexpensive fitness tracker, but is it any good? I've used it for the past month and have a good sense for what's good, bad, and whether it's even worth buying. In this video, I walk through the pros, cons, and give a recommendation at the end.

To check the latest prices on the i6HRC at Amazon, use the following links:

Video summary:
Intro
Today, I will cover the following on the i6 HR C:
 • What I like
 • What I dislike
 • Would I recommend the i6 HR C fitness tracker?

Fitness trackers
 • Fitness trackers drive positive lifestyle change
 • I've owned the following fitness trackers over time:
  ○ FitBit Flex
  ○ FitBit Charge 2
  ○ Apple Watch Series 2
  ○ iWOWNfit i6HRC
 
About iWOWNfit
 • Fitness company
  ○ 80 person company located in Shenzhen China
  ○ They build smart watches, earphones, and scales
  ○ They're a Chinese version of FitBit

What I like:
 • Extra band included in the package
 • Does the fundamentals well, including:
  ○ Counts steps
  ○ Measures heart rate
  ○ Logs distance traveled
  ○ Keep track of calories burned
  ○ Tracks sleep
 • Price is only $40!!! They achieve this by doing the following:
  ○ No separate charger, unit simply plugs into USB
  ○ One size band fits all vs. FitBit that carries inventory for multiple band sizes
  ○ Made in China
  ○ Little marketing compared to FitBit. FitBit passes the marketing cost onto consumers.
 • Color display is a nice touch
 • Interaction with device is intuitive:
  ○ Twist wrist to turn on
  ○ Short press, long press, and swipe
 • Light sensor adjusts screen brightness to conserve the battery
 • Receive all types of messages notifications, including calls, text, meetings, Facebook messenger. The FitBit Charge 2 only receives calls and text messages.
 • Lots of customization options in the app, including:
  ○ Alarms
  ○ Sedentary reminder
  ○ Set step goals

What I dislike
 • Fundamentals that are lacking compared to other fitness trackers:
  ○ Floors
  ○ Active minutes
  ○ Stopwatch
  ○ Relaxation mode
 • Weather on the device only updates when you open the app
 • No network effect by competing with others. The app just focuses on your solo achievements.
 • Screen brightness is dim, although likely prolongs the battery life.
 • Removing from the tracker from the band to charge will likely wear out the band, although they provide a second band. You can also buy additional bands for little money.
 • Only two band faces, and difficult to see number of steps. The default watch face focuses on time and not steps
 • Localization for individual markets need polish. For example, the watch calls out 10k step but should say steps with an s.
 • No weight lifting exercise mode. There are modes like ping pong and bandminton, but lacking a weight lifting mode (even though the section icon has a person lifting weights)
 • There's no dedicated button to activate the watch, which I miss from the FitBit. You interact solely through wrist movements or tapping on the screen.
 • The band is a little less comfortable than other fitness trackers I've tried in the past.
 • There's no celebration when you hit 10k steps. Fitness trackers are all about motivation and it should make a big deal out of you achieving your goal for the day.
 
Conclusion
 • Given all the pros and cons, what do I recommend?
  ○ For only $40, you really can't go wrong with this tracker. If you're not sure how much you're going to use a fitness tracker, this is a very good model to get started with. FitBit polish and feature set is better, but you pay 3x - 4x the price.",hrc hr c inexpensive fitness tracker good used past month good sense good bad whether even worth buying walk pros cons give

480,🤖 How to use Microsoft AI Builder to Extract Data from PDF,Kevin Stratvert,"In this step-by-step tutorial, learn how to use Microsoft AI Builder to extract data from a PDF document. Along with extracting text fields, tables, and text boxes, you can use AI Builder to determine text sentiment, identify objects in images, and much more. Once we extract data from the PDF you can automatically insert the data into a spreadsheet, Microsoft Teams, or any other connector. You can leverage your new AI model in Power Automate and Power Apps.

We begin by entering the fields we want to extract from the PDF. Next, we upload sample documents into a collection. With the documents uploaded, we tag the documents to teach the computer what data is contained within and where the data is located. We then train our model based on the sample documents and tagging. We then upload a sample document to ensure that the model works as we expect. Lastly, we create a Power Automate flow that leverages the model. At the end, you'll be able to automatically extract data from a PDF document.

// My Story

I am currently a software developer who once modeled and thought I wanted to pursue a career in the fashion industry. While I was modeling in Hong Kong, I eventually felt the desire to further my education. I decided to depart the modeling world and move back to Canada, knowing that could be the end of my modeling opportunities. I attended Ryerson University for GCM (Graphic Communications Management), as I thought I might still work in the fashion industry in another capacity. It was in my last year of university, I was introduced to a very basic coding course. I instantly fell in love. From there I knew I wanted to pursue software development but didn't have a clue where to start. I didn't want to go back to university as I just completed a four-year degree. I decided to enroll in a 10-week intensive coding Bootcamp. From there I started working at a small startup learning and growing my technical and soft skills. I then transitioned to a larger company where I am a software developer and technical consultant today.

1567,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Ken Jee,"Follow along here: https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/kaggle-project-from-scratch ! This is Part 2 of my kaggle project from scratch series where I analyze the kaggle data science developer survey data. 

In this video I show you how I approach data cleaning, data manipulation, and some light Exploratory data analysis. This video is meant to focus more on my process than the actual coding or results. I also use plotly for this project which is a tool I was previously unfamiliar with. I show you how I learn by getting my hands dirty. 

Part 1: https://youtu.be/r-DR9HBaipU

From a technical perspective, I do the following:
- Outline my analysis 
- load in and briefly explore the data 
- Check for null values 
- Organize the data so that it can be easily used to create charts 
- Create some basic charts with plotly express and plotly go
- Organize the data so that it can be segmented by profession 
- Build one ""advanced visual"" showing you the 4 iterations that it took me to get there. 

Resources I used:
- https://plotly.com/python/histograms/
- https://plotly.com/python/heatmaps/
- https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59406167/plotly-how-to-filter-a-pandas-dataframe-using-a-dropdown-menu

14516,Mistakes I Made in My 20's | Storytime (ft. Jenny Mustard),Lavendaire,"Today I'm reflecting on mistakes and failures from my early 20's - this one's juicy since I'm sharing stories I haven't shared before on my channel. I can finally learn to embrace these stories, rather than be ashamed of them, because they shaped me into who I am today. And I'm damn proud of who I've become today 😊 

This video is a collaboration with the lovely Jenny Mustard! I love Jenny's channel - her aesthetic and unique topics are a breath of fresh air. Make sure you check out Jenny's video for her juicy mistakes from her 20's!

5436,I used the GPT-2 AI to respond to my YouTube comments,Aaron Jack / Freemote,"I let an artificial intelligence model loose on my comments and some weird stuff happened. If we hit 20k likes (we've done it before) I'll run the AI on this entire comment section, so make sure to like and comment something you want to get a reply.

This was made using the GPT-3 AI model (774M version) and YouTube API v3.

Disclaimer: The YouTube API only works if you own the video that the comments are on.

Here's the AI if you wanna use it:
